The [CoWin API](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin) currently states : "Further, these APIs are subject to a rate limit of 100 API calls per 5 minutes per IP". I tried deploying the Web Application but the API is blocking the request. You can easily run the web application on your machine by following the steps mentioned below.

# Installing Python
Python is a programming language that is powerful but easy to learn. It is free, platform-independent, and popular among scientists.

## Recommended Method: Anaconda
The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class. Unless you have a good reason not to, we recommend that you use Anaconda.

### Mac/Linux users
1. Download the [appropriate version](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Anaconda
2. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer
3. Test it out: open a terminal window, and type ``python``, you should see something like
```
Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 17:30:36) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
```
If `Anaconda` doesn't appear on the first line, you are using a different version of Python. See the troubleshooting section below.

1. Test out the IPython notebook: open a Terminal window, and type `ipython notebook`. A new browser window should pop up.
2. Click `New Notebook` to create a new notebook file
3. Update IPython to the newest version by typing `conda update ipython` at the command line

### Windows Users
1. Download the [appropriate version](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Anaconda
2. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer.
3. Go to Start and Run Jupyter Notebook.
4. Click `New Notebook`, which should open a new page.
